    DESCRIPTION
    WikidPad exporter to emacs org-mode files (http://orgmode.org).
    
    FEATURES
    This exporter lacks a lot of features. It's just a quick hack to export some data
    from WikidPad. Feel free to improved. Current supported features:
    * Exporting data to a unique file, each word in a node.
    * It uses WikidPad parser classes to get WikidPad data.
    * It uses PyOrgMode library to generate org files.
    * It set ups links from wiki words in pages to actual nodes (inserting CUSTOM_ID properties).
    * It processes bold and italics.
    * It processes tables (only simple ones).
    * It processes horizontal rules.
    * It processes unordered and ordered lists.
    
    However this features known to be missing:
    * Does not support footnotes.
    * Does not support insertion.
    * Does not support roman lists.
    * Does not support alpha lists.
    * Does not support wikidpad anchors in text.
    * Only strategy available to layout nodes is "one word, one node".
    * Doesn't have a clever way to solve presence of headings in words.
    
    
    REQUIREMENTS
    * WikidPad version >= 2.2.
    * PyOrgMode (included).
